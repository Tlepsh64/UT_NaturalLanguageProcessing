# UT_NaturalLanguageProcessing

This is the repo containing the homeworks for the Natural Language Processing course given in the University of Tartu, Spring 2021. Please refer to the brief information below if you're interested in subject matter of them:

**1. Homework 1** is about basic text pre-processing such as tokenization and lemmatization. Beside these, basic understanding of dependency parsing and morphological tagging were also explored.

**2. Homework 3** is about understanding word embeddings by comparing TF-IDF and Doc2Vec.

**3. In Homework 4**, Convolutional Neural Networks were utilized for a multi-label text classification task. 

**4. Homework 5** was focused on using LSTMs for tagging the correct morphological features for sequences of text. To this end, character&word level embeddings together with pretrained word embeddings were fed into a final BiLSTM model.

**5. Homework 6** is somewhat of a continuation of hw5. It simply is about fine-tuning a BERT model for part of speech tagging.
